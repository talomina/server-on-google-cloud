# server-on-google-cloud

## Interactive quickstart (Compute Engine)

Terraform samples intended for inclusion in [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/).

## Setup

To run Terraform samples, the recommended approach is to use
[Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloud-shell).

Cloud Shell is a Compute Engine virtual machine. The service credentials
associated with this virtual machine are automatic, so there is no need to
set up or download a service account key.

Terraform is integrated with Cloud Shell, and Cloud Shell automatically
authenticates Terraform, letting you get started with less setup.

1. **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the
   [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/talomina/server-on-google-cloud.git
   ```

## How to run a sample
